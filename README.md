Performance comparison of ARIMA models with supervised learning algorithms to develop a higher accuracy prediction model in R for stock price forecasting on the Toronto Stock Exchange

Studying stock price movement using machine learning algorithms has a potential to make best trading decisions for minimizing the risk and maximizing profits and hence prediction has always been an interesting area of research. In this study we are comparing the performance of time series forecasting ARIMA models with non-linear supervised learning algorithms including Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network to develop a higher accuracy prediction model for RBC stock price forecasting on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
