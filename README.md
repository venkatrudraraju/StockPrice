####  Predicting Stock Price-Performance comparison of ARIMA models with supervised learning algorithms   ####

# Select closing price as a measure for stock price.  
closingP = RBC[,4]

# checking data for any missing values. 
sum(is.na(closingP))
closingP=na.omit(closingP)
# here, we can see that we have only 1 missing value and hence we can simply delete it. otherwise, we have to impute all the missing values with median.

# For time series analysis we will transform dataframe into time series dataset 
tsclosingP=ts(closingP, start = c(2011, 1), end=c(2017,1), frequency = 12)

# Plotting the data [Years on x-axis and Closing Price on Y-axis]

# It shows upward trend, seems to be non-stationary

# stationarity check using Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test

adf.test(tsclosingP, alternative = "stationary")
#here With a p-value >0.05, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of non-stationarity in our series.

# make the data stationary by differencing with 1,2,3...etc. until p-value is <0.05
