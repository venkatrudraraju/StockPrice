### FORECASTING ###

#### Load the required packages  ####

#### Download RBC historical data Yahoo finance using quantmod package ####
library(quantmod)
RBC=getSymbols('RY.TO', from='2011-01-01', to='2017-12-31', auto.assign = FALSE)


# Select closing price as a measure for stock price.  
closingP = RBC[,4]
plot(closingP, xlab='Years', ylab = 'Closing Price')

# checking data for any missing values. 
sum(is.na(closingP))
closingP=na.omit(closingP)
Here, we can see that we have only 1 missing value and hence we can simply delete it. otherwise, we have to impute all the missing values with median.


# For time series analysis we will transform dataframe into time series dataset 
tsclosingP=ts(closingP, start = c(2011, 1), end=c(2017,1), frequency = 12)


# Plotting the data [Years on x-axis and Closing Price on Y-axis]  
plot(tsclosingP, xlab='Years', ylab = 'Closing Price')
This shows upward trend, seems to be non-stationary


#### stationarity check using Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test ####
adf.test(tsclosingP, alternative = "stationary")
Here with a p-value >0.05, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of non-stationarity in our series.


# make the data stationary by differencing with 1,2,3...etc. until p-value is <0.05
tsclosingP_diff1 = diff(tsclosingP, differences = 1)
adf.test(tsclosingP_diff1, alternative="stationary")
plot.ts(tsclosingP_diff1, ylab='Differenced closing prices')


#####  ACF and PACF graphs for checking significant lags and choosing the order parameters for ARIMA model   ######
# finding MA terms or q values: 
Acf(tsclosingP, main='ACF for Differenced Series')
Acf(tsclosingP, lag.max = 100, plot = F) 
# finding AR terms or p values:
Pacf(tsclosingP, main='PACF for Differenced Series') 
pacf(tsclosingP, lag.max = 100, plot = F) 


#### Fitting an ARIMA model ####
# Identification of best fit ARIMA model by explicitly specifying the order of the model. The best model is selected with smallest AIC.
fitA=arima(tsclosingP, order = c(0,1,1))
fitA=arima(tsclosingP, order = c(0,1,2))
we can see that MA(1) has coefficient far away from 1 implies that it is stationary. Also, lesser value of AIC compared to MA(2). therefore MA(1) is the good fit for the model.     

# auto.arima() automatically generate a set of optimal parameters (p, d, q) with lowest AIC. 
fitA=auto.arima(tsclosingP, seasonal=FALSE) #non-seasonal ARIMA model.

# Price Forecast
forecastA=forecast(fitA, h=5)
accuracy(forecastA)
plot(forecastA, xlab="Years", ylab="RBC forecasted Price" )

# Residual Diagonostics
fitA_resid=residuals(fitA)
Box.test(fitA_resid, type="Ljung-Box")
we see that we have an insignificant p-value at all lags. This means that there is likely a high degree of randomness exhibited by our residuals (consistent with a random walk with drift model) and therefore our ARIMA model is free of autocorrelation.


# MODELING WITH NEURAL NETWORKS AND EVALUATING ITS ACCURACY
fitN <- nnetar(tsclosingP,seasonal=FALSE)
forecastN=forecast(fitN, h=5)
accuracy(forecastN)
plot(forecastN, xlab="Years", ylab="RBC forecasted Price")


#### RANDOM FOREST  #####
fitR = randomForest(tsclosingP ~.,data = tsclosingP, ntree=50)
predictR=predict(fitR, n.ahead=5)
plot(predictR, xlab="Years", ylab="Price for RBCstock")
